# Non-genic functional sequences {#lesson11}

## Learning Objectives

* Learn the major modular principles for how long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) could function
* Learn how lncRNAs are discovered, and methods for filtering to find the ones more likely to be functional
* Engage in the ongoing debate about how many of the lncRNAs are functional
* Critically consider the assessment that a large majority of the human genome is "functional" in the sense that the DNA sequences are subjected to a biochemical activity
