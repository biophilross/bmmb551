# Gene regulatory modules {#lesson10}

## Learning Objectives

* Describe how to use genomic-wide epigenetic data to find DNA sequences involved in gene regulation.
* Identify features associated with gene regulation (altered chromatin, histone modification, occupancy by RNA polymerase and transcription factors)
* Compare various sequence census methods.
* Interpret information from high-throughput methods that measure features with gene regulation comprehensively with high resolution across genomes.
