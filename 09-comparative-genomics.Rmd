# Comparative genomices {#lesson9}

## Learning Objectives

* Distinguish neutral evolution, negative selection, and positive selection
* Interpret alignments of genomic DNA sequences as showing evidence of evolutionary constraint or adaptation, distinguishing both from evidence consistent with neutral evolution.
* Show how you can use genome comparisons between species to estimate the amount of functional sequence â€“ and to identify it
* Understand the basics of several tests for selection or scores that estimate likelihood of being under selection
    * Ka/Ks test
    * phastCons
    * Extended haplotype homozygosity
* Understand the connection between gene duplication and adaptive evolution
